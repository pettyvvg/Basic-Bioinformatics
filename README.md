  Bioinformatics refers the application of statistics and computer science to the management and analysis 
of data from the biosciences. In common with computational linguistics, the field shares the task of detecting 
and searching for patterns in gigantic datasets. For this project you search for DNA sequences in chromosomes 
19, 20 and 21 in the hg19 GRCh37 human genome in which provide in LEB2. These base pairs are represented 
in text form, so the problem is essentially a text processing problem. There are 4,965 target sequences. You will 
store the search targets in a prefix trie and make a single pass through the genome corpus.  

**DNA files are too big to upload.**
